# Axis-Order-Bot
この素晴らしい世界にアクシズ教信を！

This bot is now running on Heroku! 

Uses Peewee as ORM, with PostgreSQL as the DB.

This is still a work in progress.

TODO: 
- Implement "dailies" using timestamped fields. 
- Think of a way to get around Heroku's 10000 row limit in DB without paying.
- Rank-based permission to various functions
- Ways to spend points
